# Sukuna - Saga Orchestrator

A very tiny PoC of a saga orchestrator!

To discovery the functionalities you can download the postman collection [here](Sukuna.postman_collection.json)

Also, you can check out my initial idea [here](https://detailed-snowplow-0e4.notion.site/Sukuna-Saga-Orchestrator-471423455c47447c888953d9f9e69ae4)

To set up the application:
```shell
docker-compose up -d
make migrate
```

> You should start the apps inside `apps_for_saga` in order to use the full example!
